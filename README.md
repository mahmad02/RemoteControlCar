# RC_Car
Microcontroller based RC Car designed for Introduction to Embedded Systems Class @ ncsu

This is a project in which we designed an embedded system controlled remote control car. The car can detect black lines using infrared lights paired with infrared detectors. In designing this car we learned how to:
    read datasheets,
    set up ports for peripherals,
    set up clocks,
    exhibit an understanding of power usage,
    control the car over the internet (IoT),
    and allow for autonomous and controlled portions for a final circuit.


This repository contains two main project folders: LineDetect, and FullCircuit.

LineDetect is a project in which the car drives forward until it detects a line then continuously follows it.

FullCircuit is a project in which the car has full capability to follow a circuit that is explained within the file. The circuit consists of both remote controlled and autonomous portions. It essentially adds IoT to the LineDetect project.
